 Data Structures

versioning).

customized model field types for storing files attached to your ORM
document. 
 SQLAlchemy-ImageAttach

and SqlAlchemy's mutable facility, Also supports multiple stores per context. 
 
 
 Forms and Data Validations

 ColanderAlchemy helps you to auto-generate  Colander  schemas that are based
on SQLAlchemy mapped classes. 
 Such Colander schemas can be used with libraries like  Deform  and helps
remove the need for duplication of schema definitions.

 Data validator for Flask and SQL-Alchemy, working at Model component
with events, preventing invalid data in the columns.
The extension works with event listeners from SQLAlchemy. 
 FormAlchemy 
 FormAlchemy eliminates boilerplate by autogenerating HTML input fields from a
given model. FormAlchemy will try to figure out what kind of HTML code should
be returned by introspecting the model's properties and generate ready-to-use
HTML code that will fit the developer's application. 
 WTForms-Alchemy 
 WTForms-Alchemy is a  WTForms  extension toolkit for easier creation of
model based forms.  Strongly influenced by Django ModelForm. 
 Sprox 
 Sprox provides an easy way to create forms for web content which are:
automatically generated, easy to customize, and validated. Sprox also
has powerful tools to help you display your content the way you want
to with table and record viewers. Sprox provides a way to fill your
widgets, whether they are forms or other content with customizable data.

 GeoAlchemy 2 
 GeoAlchemy 2 provides extensions to SQLAlchemy for working with
spatial databases. 
 GeoAlchemy 2 focuses on  PostGIS .  PostGIS 1.5 and PostGIS 2 are supported.
