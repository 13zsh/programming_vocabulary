 butterdb is a library to help you work with Google Spreadsheet data. It lets you model your data as Python objects, to be easily manipulated or created. 
 
 How do I use it? 
 
 import butterdb
import json

# For getting OAuth Credential JSON file see http://gspread.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2.html
# Ensure that the client_email has been granted privileges to any workbooks you wish to access.

with open('SomeGoogleProject-2a31d827b2a9.json') as credentials_file:
   json_key = json.load(credentials_file)

client_email = json_key['client_email']
private_key = str(json_key['private_key']).encode('utf-8')

database = butterdb.Database(name="MyDatabaseSheet", client_email=client_email, private_key=private_key)

@butterdb.register(database)
class User(butterdb.Model):
    def __init__(self, name, password):
        self.name = self.field(name)
        self.password = self.field(password)

users = User.get_instances()

marianne = users[1]

print(marianne.password) # rainbow_trout

marianne.password = "hunter2"
marianne.commit()
 
 
 How do I make instances? 
 bob = User("bob", "BestPassword!")
bob.commit()
 
 
 Where do I get it? 
 pip install butterdb 
 
 Simple as that? 
 Yep! butterdb is a simple interface around  gspread . Just .commit() your objects when you want to update the spreadsheet! 
 
 How do I run the tests? 
 nosetests 
 
 What works? 
 
 Store data in Google Spreadsheets (the cloud!!!) 
 Models from classes 
 Fields as attributes. decimals, ints and strings only (as far as I know) 
 Commits 
 Mocked unit tests, mock database 
 Arbitrary cell execution with =blah() (free stored procedures?) 
 Auto backup/bad patch control 
 
 
 What's missing? 
 
 Spreadsheets must exist before connecting 
 References 
 Collections 
 Customizable fields 
 Customizable table size (arbitrarily hardcoded)
