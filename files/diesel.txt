 Why Diesel? 
 You should write your next network application using  diesel . 
 Thanks to  Python  the syntax is clean and the development pace is rapid. Thanks
to non-blocking I/O it's fast and scalable. Thanks to  greenlets  there's
unwind(to(callbacks(no))). Thanks to  nose  it's trivial to test. Thanks to
 Flask  you don't need to write a new web framework using it. 
 It provides a clean API for writing network clients and servers. TCP and UDP
supported. It bundles battle-tested clients for HTTP, DNS, Redis, Riak and
MongoDB. It makes writing network applications fun. 
 Read the documentation, browse the API and join the community in #diesel on
freenode. 
 
 Prerequisites 
 You'll need the python-dev package as well as libffi-dev, or your
platform's equivalents.
