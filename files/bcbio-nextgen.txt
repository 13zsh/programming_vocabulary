 Validated, scalable, community developed variant calling, RNA-seq and small RNA
analysis. You write a high level configuration file specifying your inputs and
analysis parameters. This input drives a parallel run that handles distributed
execution, idempotent processing restarts and safe transactional steps. bcbio
provides a shared community resource that handles the data processing component
of sequencing analysis, providing researchers with more time to focus on the
downstream biology. 
 
 
 Features 
 
 Community developed: We welcome contributors with the goal of
overcoming the biological, algorithmic and computational challenges
that face individual developers working on complex pipelines in
quickly changing research areas. See our  users page  for examples
of bcbio-nextgen deployments, and the  developer documentation  for
tips on contributing. 
 Installation:  A single installer script  prepares all
third party software, data libraries and system configuration files. 
 Automated validation : Compare variant calls against common reference
materials or sample specific SNP arrays to ensure call correctness.
Incorporation of multiple approaches for alignment, preparation and
variant calling enable unbiased comparisons of algorithms. 
 Distributed: Focus on  parallel analysis and scaling  to handle
large population studies and whole genome analysis. Runs on single
multicore computers, in compute clusters using  IPython parallel ,
or on the Amazon cloud. See the  parallel documentation  for full
details. 
 Multiple analysis algorithms: bcbio-nextgen provides configurable
 variant calling, RNA-seq and small RNA pipelines . 
 
 
 Quick start 
 
 Install   bcbio-nextgen  with all tool dependencies and data files: 
 wget https://raw.github.com/chapmanb/bcbio-nextgen/master/scripts/bcbio_nextgen_install.py
python bcbio_nextgen_install.py /usr/local/share/bcbio --tooldir=/usr/local \
  --genomes GRCh37 --aligners bwa --aligners bowtie2
 
 producing an editable  system configuration file  referencing the installed
software, data and system information. 
 
 Automatically create a processing description  of sample FASTQ and BAM files
from your project, and a CSV file of sample metadata: 
 bcbio_nextgen.py -w template freebayes-variant project1.csv sample1.bam sample2_1.fq sample2_2.fq
 
 This produces a  sample description file  containing pipeline  configuration options . 
 
 Run analysis, distributed across 8 local cores: 
 cd project1/work
bcbio_nextgen.py ../config/project1.yaml -n 8
