 Mediator pattern example in java 
 
 
 
 
 
 2 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 Mediator  pattern defines an object (Mediator) that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It enables many-to-many communication. 
 UML diagram: 
 
 Key components: 
 Mediator:  Defines an interface for communication between Colleagues. 
 Colleague : Is an abstract class, which defines the events to be communicated between Colleagues 
 ConcreteMediator : Implements cooperative behavior by coordinating  Colleague  objects and maintains its colleagues 
 ConcreteColleague : Implements the notification operations received through  Mediator , which has been generated by other  Colleague 
 One real world example: 
 You are maintaining a network of computers in  Mesh  topology. 
 A mesh network is a network topology in which each node relays data for the network. All mesh nodes cooperate in the distribution of data in the network. 
 If a new computer is added Or existing computer is removed, all other computers in that network should know about these two events. 
 Let's see how Mediator pattern fits into it. 
 Code snippet: 
 import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

/* Define the contract for communication between Colleagues. 
   Implementation is left to ConcreteMediator */
interface Mediator{
    void register(Colleague colleague);
    void unregister(Colleague colleague);
}
/* Define the contract for notification events from Mediator. 
   Implementation is left to ConcreteColleague
*/
abstract class Colleague{
    private Mediator mediator;
    private String name;
    
    public Colleague(Mediator mediator,String name){
        this.mediator = mediator;
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String toString(){
        return name;
    }
    public abstract void receiveRegisterNotification(Colleague colleague);
    public abstract void receiveUnRegisterNotification(Colleague colleague);    
}
/*  Process notification event raised by other Colleague through Mediator.   
*/
class ComputerColleague extends Colleague {
    private Mediator mediator;
    
    public ComputerColleague(Mediator mediator,String name){
        super(mediator,name);
    }
    public  void receiveRegisterNotification(Colleague colleague){
        System.out.println("New Computer register event with name:"+colleague+
        ": received @"+this);
        // Send further messages to this new Colleague from now onwards
    }
    public  void receiveUnRegisterNotification(Colleague colleague){
        System.out.println("Computer left unregister event with name:"+colleague+
        ":received @"+this);
        // Do not send further messages to this Colleague from now onwards
    }
}
/* Act as a central hub for communication between different Colleagues. 
   Notifies all Concrete Colleagues on occurrence of an event
*/
class NetworkMediator implements Mediator{
    List<Colleague> colleagues = new ArrayList<Colleague>();
    
    public NetworkMediator(){
    
    }
    
    public void register(Colleague colleague){
        colleagues.add(colleague);
        for (Colleague other : colleagues){
            if ( other != colleague){
                other.receiveRegisterNotification(colleague);
            }
        }
    }
    public void unregister(Colleague colleague){
        colleagues.remove(colleague);
        for (Colleague other : colleagues){
            other.receiveUnRegisterNotification(colleague);
        }
    }
}

public class MediatorPatternDemo{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        Mediator mediator = new NetworkMediator();
        ComputerColleague colleague1 = new ComputerColleague(mediator,"Eagle");
        ComputerColleague colleague2 = new ComputerColleague(mediator,"Ostrich");
        ComputerColleague colleague3 = new ComputerColleague(mediator,"Penguin");
        mediator.register(colleague1);
        mediator.register(colleague2);
        mediator.register(colleague3);
        mediator.unregister(colleague1);
    }
}
 
 output: 
 New Computer register event with name:Ostrich: received @Eagle
New Computer register event with name:Penguin: received @Eagle
New Computer register event with name:Penguin: received @Ostrich
Computer left unregister event with name:Eagle:received @Ostrich
Computer left unregister event with name:Eagle:received @Penguin
 
 Explanation: 
 
 Eagle  is added to network at first through register event. No notifications to any other colleagues since Eagle is the first one. 
 When  Ostrich  is added to the network,  Eagle  is notified : Line 1 of output is rendered now. 
 When  Penguin  is added to network, both  Eagle  and  Ostrich   have been notified : Line 2 and Line 3 of output is rendered now. 
 When  Eagle  left the network through unregister event, both  Ostrich  and  Penguin  have been notified. Line 4 and Line 5 of output is rendered now.
