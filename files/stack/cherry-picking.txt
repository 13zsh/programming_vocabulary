 Introduction 
 
 A cherry-pick takes the patch that was introduced in a commit and tries to reapply it on the branch you’re currently on.

 Copying a commit from one branch to another 
 
 
 
 
 
 53 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 git cherry-pick <commit-hash>  will apply the changes made in an existing commit to another branch, while recording a new commit.  Essentially, you can copy commits from branch to branch. 
 Given the following tree  (Source) 
 dd2e86 - 946992 - 9143a9 - a6fd86 - 5a6057 [master]
           \
            76cada - 62ecb3 - b886a0 [feature]
 
 Let's say we want to copy  b886a0  to master (on top of  5a6057 ). 
 We can run 
 git checkout master
git cherry-pick b886a0
 
 Now our tree will look something like: 
 dd2e86 - 946992 - 9143a9 - a6fd86 - 5a6057 - a66b23 [master]
           \
            76cada - 62ecb3 - b886a0 [feature]
 
 Where the new commit  a66b23  has the same content (source diff, commit message) as  b886a0  (but a different parent). Note that cherry-picking will only pick up changes on that commit( b886a0  in this case) not all the changes in feature branch (for this you will have to either use rebasing or merging).

 git cherry-pick <commit-A>..<commit-B>  will place every commit  after  A and up to and including B on top of the currently checked-out branch. 
 git cherry-pick <commit-A>^..<commit-B>  will place commit A and every commit up to and including B on top of the currently checked-out branch.

 Checking if a cherry-pick is required 
 
 
 
 
 
 7 
 
 
 Before you start the cherry-pick process, you can check if the commit you want to cherry-pick already exists in the target branch, in which case you don't have to do anything. 
 git branch --contains <commit>  lists local branches that contain the specified commit. 
 git branch -r --contains <commit>  also includes remote tracking branches in the list.

+ b6ce3b78e938644a293b2dd2a15b2fecb1b54cd9
 
 The commits that being with  +  will be the ones that haven't yet cherry-picked into  development .

 Parameters 
 Parameters Details -e, --edit With this option,  git cherry-pick  will let you edit the commit message prior to committing. -x When recording the commit, append a line that says "(cherry picked from commit …​)" to the original commit message in order to indicate which commit this change was cherry-picked from. This is done only for cherry picks without conflicts. --ff If the current HEAD is the same as the parent of the cherry-pick’ed commit, then a fast forward to this commit will be performed. --continue Continue the operation in progress using the information in .git/sequencer. Can be used to continue after resolving conflicts in a failed cherry-pick or revert. --quit Forget about the current operation in progress. Can be used to clear the sequencer state after a failed cherry-pick or revert. --abort Cancel the operation and return to the pre-sequence state.
