 Matrix Exponentiation to Solve Example Problems

 Find f(n): n th  Fibonacci number.  The problem is quite easy when  n  is relatively small. We can use simple recursion,  f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) , or we can use dynamic programming approach to avoid the calculation of same function over and over again. But what will you do if the problem says,  Given 0 < n < 10⁹, find f(n) mod 999983?  Dynamic programming will fail, so how do we tackle this problem? 
 First let's see how matrix exponentiation can help to represent recursive relation. 
 Prerequisites: 
 
 Given two matrices, know how to find their product. Further, given the product matrix of two matrices, and one of them, know how to find the other matrix. 
 Given a matrix of size  d X d , know how to find its n th  power in  O(d 3 log(n)) . 
 
 Patterns: 
 At first we need a recursive relation and we want to find a matrix  M  which can lead us to the desired state from a set of already known states. Let's assume that, we know the  k  states of a given recurrence relation and we want to find the  (k+1) th  state. Let  M  be a  k X k  matrix, and we build a matrix  A:[k X 1]  from the known states of the recurrence relation, now we want to get a matrix  B:[k X 1]  which will represent the set of next states, i. e.  M X A = B  as shown below: 
        |  f(n)  |     | f(n+1) |
       | f(n-1) |     |  f(n)  |
   M X | f(n-2) |  =  | f(n-1) |
       | ...... |     | ...... |
       | f(n-k) |     |f(n-k+1)|
 
 So, if we can design  M  accordingly, our job will be done! The matrix will then be used to represent the recurrence relation. 
 Type 1:   
Let's start with the simplest one,  f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)   
We get,  f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) .  
Let's assume, we know  f(n)  and  f(n-1) ; We want to find out  f(n+1) .  
From the situation stated above, matrix  A  and matrix  B  can be formed as shown below: 
  Matrix A          Matrix B

|  f(n)  |        | f(n+1) |
| f(n-1) |        |  f(n)  |
 
 [Note: Matrix  A  will be always designed in such a way that, every state on which  f(n+1)  depends, will be present]  
Now, we need to design a  2X2  matrix  M  such that, it satisfies  M X A = B  as stated above.  
The first element of  B  is  f(n+1)  which is actually  f(n) + f(n-1) . To get this, from matrix  A , we need,  1 X f(n)  and  1 X f(n-1) . So the first row of  M  will be  [1 1] . 
 | 1   1 |  X  |  f(n)  |  =  | f(n+1) |
| ----- |     | f(n-1) |     | ------ |
 
 [Note: ----- means we are not concerned about this value.]  
Similarly, 2nd item of  B  is  f(n)  which can be got by simply taking  1 X f(n)  from  A , so the 2nd row of  M  is [1 0]. 
 | ----- |  X  |  f(n)  |  =  | ------ |
| 1   0 |     | f(n-1) |     |  f(n)  |
 
 Then we get our desired  2 X 2  matrix  M . 
 | 1   1 |  X  |  f(n)  |  =  | f(n+1) |
| 1   0 |     | f(n-1) |     |  f(n)  |
 
 These matrices are simply derived using matrix multiplication. 
 Type 2: 
 Let's make it a little complex: find  f(n) = a X f(n-1) + b X f(n-2) , where  a  and  b  are constants. 
This tells us,  f(n+1) = a X f(n) + b X f(n-1) .  
By this far, this should be clear that the dimension of the matrices will be equal to the number of dependencies, i.e. in this particular example, again 2. So for  A  and  B , we can build two matrices of size  2 X 1 : 
 Matrix A             Matrix B
|  f(n)  |          | f(n+1) |
| f(n-1) |          |  f(n)  |
 
 Now for  f(n+1) = a X f(n) + b X f(n-1) , we need [a, b] in the first row of objective matrix  M . And for the 2nd item in  B , i.e.  f(n)  we already have that in matrix  A , so we just take that, which leads, the 2nd row of the matrix M to [1 0]. This time we get: 
 | a   b |  X  |  f(n)  |  =  | f(n+1) |
| 1   0 |     | f(n-1) |     |  f(n)  |
 
 Pretty simple, eh? 
 Type 3: 
 If you've survived through to this stage, you've grown much older, now let's face a bit complex relation: find  f(n) = a X f(n-1) + c X f(n-3) ? 
Ooops! A few minutes ago, all we saw were contiguous states, but here, the state  f(n-2)  is missing. Now? 
 Actually this is not a problem anymore, we can convert the relation as follows:  f(n) = a X f(n-1) + 0 X f(n-2) + c X f(n-3) , deducing  f(n+1) = a X f(n) + 0 X f(n-1) + c X f(n-2) . Now, we see that, this is actually a form described in Type 2. So here the objective matrix  M  will be  3 X 3 , and the elements are: 
 | a 0 c |     |  f(n)  |     | f(n+1) |
| 1 0 0 |  X  | f(n-1) |  =  |  f(n)  |
| 0 1 0 |     | f(n-2) |     | f(n-1) |
 
 These are calculated in the same way as type 2, if you find it difficult, try it on pen and paper. 
 Type 4: 
 Life is getting complex as hell, and Mr, Problem now asks you to find  f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + c  where  c  is any constant.  
Now this is a new one and all we have seen in past, after the multiplication, each state in  A  transforms to its next state in  B . 
 f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) + c
f(n+1) = f(n) + f(n-1) + c
f(n+2) = f(n+1) + f(n) + c
.................... so on
 
 So , normally we can't get it through previous fashion, but how about we add  c  as a state: 
       |  f(n)  |   | f(n+1) |
  M X | f(n-1) | = |  f(n)  |
      |    c   |   |    c   |
 
 Now, its not much hard to design  M . Here's how its done, but don't forget to verify: 
   | 1 1 1 |     |  f(n)  |     | f(n+1) |
  | 1 0 0 |  X  | f(n-1) |  =  |  f(n)  |
  | 0 0 1 |     |    c   |     |    c   |
 
 Type 5: 
 Let's put it altogether: find  f(n) = a X f(n-1) + c X f(n-3) + d X f(n-4) + e .
Let's leave it as an exercise for you. First try to find out the states and matrix  M . And check if it matches with your solution. Also find matrix  A  and  B . 
 | a 0 c d 1 |
| 1 0 0 0 0 |
| 0 1 0 0 0 |
| 0 0 1 0 0 |
| 0 0 0 0 1 |
 
 Type 6: 
 Sometimes the recurrence is given like this: 
 f(n) = f(n-1)   -> if n is odd
f(n) = f(n-2)   -> if n is even
 
 In short: 
 f(n) = (n&1) X f(n-1) + (!(n&1)) X f(n-2)
 
 Here, we can split the functions in the basis of odd even and keep 2 different matrix for both of them and calculate them separately. 
 Type 7: 
 Feeling little too confident? Good for you. Sometimes we may need to maintain more than one recurrence, where they are interested. For example, let a recurrence re;atopm be: 
 g(n) = 2g(n-1) + 2g(n-2) + f(n)
 
 Here, recurrence  g(n)  is dependent upon  f(n)  and this can be calculated in the same matrix but of increased dimensions. From these let's at first design the matrices  A  and  B . 
  Matrix A            Matrix B
|  g(n)  |          | g(n+1) |
| g(n-1) |          |  g(n)  |
| f(n+1) |          | f(n+2) |
|  f(n)  |          | f(n+1) |
 
 Here,  g(n+1) = 2g(n-1) + f(n+1) and f(n+2) = 2f(n+1) + 2f(n) .
Now, using the processes stated above, we can find the objective matrix  M  to be: 
 | 2 2 1 0 |
| 1 0 0 0 |
| 0 0 2 2 |
| 0 0 1 0 |
 
 So, these are the basic categories of recurrence relations which are used to solveby this simple technique.
