 Adding django-extensions example will help. It makes debugging easier with commands like shell_plus, runserver_plus, etc.

 Using Django Debug Toolbar 
 
 
 
 
 
 4 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 First, you need to install  django-debug-toolbar : 
 pip install django-debug-toolbar
 
 settings.py : 
 Next, include it to project's installed apps, but be careful - it's always a good practice to use a different  settings.py  file for such development-only apps and middlewares as debug toolbar: 
 # If environment is dev...
DEBUG = True

INSTALLED_APPS += [
    'debug_toolbar',
]

MIDDLEWARE += ['debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware']
 
 Debug toolbar also relies on static files, so appropriate app should be included as well: 
 INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    # ...
]

STATIC_URL = '/static/'

# If environment is dev...
DEBUG = True

INSTALLED_APPS += [
    'debug_toolbar',
]
 
 In some cases, it's also required to set  INTERNAL_IPS  in  settings.py : 
 INTERNAL_IPS = ('127.0.0.1', )
 
 urls.py : 
 In  urls.py , as official documentation suggests, the next snippet should enable debug toolbar routing: 
 if settings.DEBUG and 'debug_toolbar' in settings.INSTALLED_APPS:
    import debug_toolbar
    urlpatterns += [
        url(r'^__debug__/', include(debug_toolbar.urls)),
    ]
 
 Collect toolbar's static after installation: 
 python manage.py collectstatic
 
 That's it, debug toolbar will appear on you project's pages, providing various useful information about execution time, SQL, static files, signals, etc. 
 HTML: 
 Also,  django-debug-toolbar  requires a  Content-type  of  text/html ,  <html>  and  <body>  tags to render properly. 
 
 In case if you sure you've configured everything right, but debug toolbar is still not rendered:  use  this "nuclear" solution  to try to figure it out.

 Using Python Debugger (Pdb) 
 
 
 
 
 
 3 
 
 
 Most basic Django debugging tool is  pdb , a part of Python standard library. 
 Init view script 
 Let's examine a simple  views.py  script: 
 from django.http import HttpResponse


def index(request):
    foo = 1
    bar = 0

    bug = foo/bar

    return HttpResponse("%d goes here." % bug)
 
 Console command to run server: 
 python manage.py runserver
 
 It's obvious that Django would throw a  ZeroDivisionError  when you try to load index page, but if we'll pretend that the bug is very deep in the code, it could get really nasty. 
 Setting a breakpoint 
 Fortunately, we can set a  breakpoint  to trace down that bug: 
 from django.http import HttpResponse

# Pdb import
import pdb


def index(request):
    foo = 1
    bar = 0
    
    # This is our new breakpoint
    pdb.set_trace()
    
    bug = foo/bar
    
    return HttpResponse("%d goes here." % bug)
 
 Console command to run server with pdb: 
 python -m pdb manage.py runserver
 
 Now on page load breakpoint will trigger (Pdb) prompt in the shell, which will also hang your browser in pending state. 
 Debugging with pdb shell 
 It's time to debug that view by interacting with script via shell: 
 > ../views.py(12)index()
-> bug = foo/bar
# input 'foo/bar' expression to see division results:
(Pdb) foo/bar
*** ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
# input variables names to check their values:
(Pdb) foo
1
(Pdb) bar
0
# 'bar' is a source of the problem, so if we set it's value > 0...
(Pdb) bar = 1
(Pdb) foo/bar
1.0
# exception gone, ask pdb to continue execution by typing 'c':
(Pdb) c
[03/Aug/2016 10:50:45] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 111
 
 In the last line we see that our view returned an  OK  response and executing as it should. 
 To stop pdb loop, just input  q  in a shell.

 Consider Writing More Documentation, Tests, Logging and Assertions Instead of Using a Debugger 
 
 
 
 
 
 1 
 
 
 Debugging takes time and effort. 
 Instead of chasing bugs with a debugger, consider spending more time on making your code better by: 
 
 Write and run  Tests .   Python and Django have great builtin testing frameworks - that can be used to test your code much faster than manually with a debugger. 
 Writing proper documentation  for your functions, classes and modules.   PEP 257  and
 Google's Python Style Guide  supplies good practices for writing good docstrings. 
 Use Logging  to produce output from your program - during development and after deploying. 
 Add  assert ions  to your code in important places: Reduce ambiguity, catch problems as they are created. 
 
 Bonus: Write  doctests  for combining documentation and testing!

 Using "assert False" 
 
 
 
 
 
 1 
 
 
 While developing, inserting the following line to your code: 
 assert False, value
 
 will cause django to raise an  AssertionError  with the value supplied as an error message when this line is executed. 
 If this occurs in a view, or in any code called from a view, and  DEBUG=True  is set, a full and detailed stacktrace with a lot of debugging information will be displayed in the browser. 
 Don't forget to remove the line when you are done!
