 Optimal, disjoint-set based implementation 
 
 
 
 
 
 1 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 We can do two things to improve the simple and sub-optimal disjoint-set subalgorithms: 
 
 
 Path compression heuristic :  findSet  does not need to ever handle a tree with height bigger than  2 . If it ends up iterating such a tree, it can link the lower nodes directly to the root, optimizing future traversals; 
 subalgo findSet(v: a node):
    if v.parent != v
        v.parent = findSet(v.parent)
    return v.parent
 
 
 
 Height-based merging heuristic : for each node, store the height of its subtree. When merging, make the taller tree the parent of the smaller one, thus not increasing anyone's height. 
 subalgo unionSet(u, v: nodes):
    vRoot = findSet(v)
    uRoot = findSet(u)

    if vRoot == uRoot:
        return

    if vRoot.height < uRoot.height:
        vRoot.parent = uRoot
    else if vRoot.height > uRoot.height:
        uRoot.parent = vRoot
    else:
        uRoot.parent = vRoot
        uRoot.height =  uRoot.height + 1
 
 
 
 This leads to  O(alpha(n))  time for each operation, where  alpha  is the inverse of the fast-growing Ackermann function, thus it is very slow growing, and can be considered  O(1)  for practical purposes. 
 This makes the entire Kruskal's algorithm  O(m log m + m) = O(m log m) , because of the initial sorting. 
 Note 
 Path compression may reduce the height of the tree, hence comparing heights of the trees during union operation might not be a trivial task. Hence to avoid the complexity of storing and calculating the height of the trees the resulting parent can be picked randomly: 
     subalgo unionSet(u, v: nodes):
        vRoot = findSet(v)
        uRoot = findSet(u)

        if vRoot == uRoot:
            return
        if random() % 2 == 0:
            vRoot.parent = uRoot
        else:
            uRoot.parent = vRoot
 
 In practice this randomised algorithm together with path compression for  findSet  operation will result in comparable performance, yet much simpler to implement.

 Simple, disjoint-set based implementation

 The above forest methodology is actually a disjoint-set data structure, which involves three main operations: 
 subalgo makeSet(v: a node):
    v.parent = v    <- make a new tree rooted at v
    

subalgo findSet(v: a node):
    if v.parent == v:
        return v
    return findSet(v.parent)

subalgo unionSet(v, u: nodes):
    vRoot = findSet(v)
    uRoot = findSet(u)

    uRoot.parent = vRoot

algorithm kruskalMST''(G: a graph):
    sort G's edges by their value
    for each node n in G:
        makeSet(n)
    for each edge e in G:
        if findSet(e.first) != findSet(e.second):
            unionSet(e.first, e.second)
 
 This naive implementation leads to  O(n log n)  time for managing the disjoint-set data structure, leading to  O(m*n log n)  time for the entire Kruskal's algorithm.

 Sort the edges by value and add each one to the MST in sorted order, if it doesn't create a cycle. 
 algorithm kruskalMST(G: a graph)
    sort G's edges by their value
    MST = an empty graph
    for each edge e in G:
        if adding e to MST does not create a cycle:
            add e to MST

    return MST

 Simple, more detailed implementation

 In order to efficiently handle cycle detection, we consider each node as part of a tree. When adding an edge, we check if its two component nodes are part of distinct trees. Initially, each node makes up a one-node tree. 
 algorithm kruskalMST'(G: a graph)
    sort G's edges by their value
    MST = a forest of trees, initially each tree is a node in the graph
    for each edge e in G:
        if the root of the tree that e.first belongs to is not the same 
        as the root of the tree that e.second belongs to:
            connect one of the roots to the other, thus merging two trees
    
    return MST, which now a single-tree forest

 Remarks 
 Kruskal's Algorithm is a  greedy  algorithm used to find  Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)  of a graph. A minimum spanning tree is a tree which connects all the vertices of the graph and has the minimum total edge weight. 
 Kruskal's algorithm does so by repeatedly picking out edges with  minimum weight  (which are not already in the MST) and add them to the final result if the two vertices connected by that edge are not yet connected in the MST, otherwise it skips that edge. Union - Find data structure can be used to check whether two vertices are already connected in the MST or not. A few properties of MST are as follows: 
 
 A MST of a graph with  n  vertices will have exactly  n-1  edges. 
 There exists a unique path from each vertex to every other vertex.
